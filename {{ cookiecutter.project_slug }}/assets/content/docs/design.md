## Architecture Overview

The FastHTML SaaS Boilerplate Creator is built using the following components:

2. Starlette: The ASGI framework used by FastHTML
3. SQLAlchemy: For database interactions (when applicable)
4. HTMX: For dynamic frontend interactions
5. Pico CSS: For basic styling (optional)
